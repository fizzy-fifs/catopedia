# Catopedia

Catopedia is a simple wiki application that provides users with detailed information on sixty-seven different cat breeds. Built as a single page application, catopedia is the result of a tech test and was designed based on the following specifications:
  * Sign up and create an API key at https://thecatapi.com/
  * Create an app that retrieves some data from one of the cat API endpoints (of your choice) and renders it on a web page. (Be creative!) 

## Approach
 ### Planning
 The planning stage produced the following user stories:
```
   As a cat lover
  So that I can learn more about cats
  I would like to see all available cat breeds 

  As a cat lover
  So that I can learn more about cats
  I would like to see information about a selected breed

  As a cat lover
  So that I can learn even more about my favourite breed
  I would like to be directed to a credible external source with more  information on a selected breed

```

### Implementation
  Test Driven Development was used in implementing each feature higlighted in the user stories. Git and github was used for version control, with regular commits made. 
  
### Deployment
 Heroku was used to host this application

## Tech/framework used
### Built with

  * React.Js 17.0.2

### Testing Framework
  * React Testing Library 11.1.0

## Usage
Catopedia is a web application designed to run on a web browser.

To run:

Alternatively, catopedia can be installed on a local machine and run via local host.
